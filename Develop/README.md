# 12-who-works-where

## Description

This nifty application helps companies built out their employee database in a few simple steps that we will cover in the usage section. 

The biggest challenge of this project was understanding how each file works with each other, what data needs to be exported, and where other data needed to be brought into functions. Also the various formats for doing each task â€” it seems like everyone you ask has a completely different way of solving an issue, which is fascinating, but sometimes hard to learn from.
